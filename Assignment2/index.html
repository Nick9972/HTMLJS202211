        <p>My name is <b>Nick</b> and I'm from Maine. I enjoy video games, rock climbing, walking, and reading. My HS offered rock clibming as a class and that's when I first discovered how much fun it could be. My friends and I used to walk around the town of Windham before we had cars and would just spend our time inside random stores looking around buying random stupid things. I took that 'skill' of walking to get my first job at a doggy daycare walking and taking care of dogs. It was the best first job I probably couldv'e asked for. I took pictures of about every dog I could so I have about 70 pictures of random peoples dogs. I left that job and went to work at Goodwill. I worked as a retail assosiate for about 6 months before school and it definetly had its downsides like crappy customers or a parent who lets their kid loose and they would make noise walking around in heels then leave those heels in a random aisle where they would then pick up a kids microphone and run around the store yelling into it. Rant aside it was an alright job. I met some cool people there. That puts me at 205 words so time to think of more. I have a german shepard, Ember, and a cat, Cinder. So yeah, that's about me, mostly the jobs I had but it works.</p>
